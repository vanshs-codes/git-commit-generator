## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanshs-codes/git-commit-generator.git
cd git-commit-generator
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

### 3. Set Up Your API Key

The tool needs a global configuration file to store your Gemini API key.

- Navigate to your home directory (cd ~).
- Create a file named .gcm-config.json.
- Add your API key to the file in JSON format:

```json
{
  "GEMINI_API_KEY": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
}

## Usage

To use the tool, first stage the changes. Then run:
```bash
gcm
```

The tool will use AI to generate conventional commit messages which can be then directly copied to the clipboard by typing 'y'.

All of the commit messages of this project itself except "initial project setup" are the ones recommended by the tool itself.
